I'll create a 1200x630px PNG image with the boat scanner logo centered on a blue gradient background with "TheBoatScanner" text below. Since I can't generate images directly, I'll use the uploaded logo as the source and create an HTML canvas approach or use the existing logo with proper sizing.

For now, I'll copy the uploaded logo to the correct location and update the meta tags. The image should be manually created at 1200x630px with the logo centered and text below.
