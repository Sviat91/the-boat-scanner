# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: 28 June 2025_

The Boat Scanner (“we”, “our”, “us”) provides a reverse‑image search service for boat classifieds at **theboatscanner.com**. We are committed to protecting your privacy and to being transparent about what data we process and why.

## 1.  What data we collect

| Category                | Data                                                                           | Source                                                      |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Account**             | Google‑login e‑mail address                                                    | Google OAuth consent screen                                 |
| **Support**             | Any information you include in support messages                                | Contact form / e‑mail                                       |
| **Payments**            | Order ID, amount, payment method details (via LemonSqueezy)                    | LemonSqueezy Checkout (data stored by LemonSqueezy, not us) |
| **Anti‑fraud registry** | Google‑login e‑mail address (flagged as "deleted" when you remove the account) | Internal record on first sign‑up                            |
| **Analytics**           | Aggregated page‑view counts, country, device type                              | Umami & Cloudflare (cookieless)                             |

We do **not** collect passwords, profile photos, IP addresses for tracking, or any behavioural cookies.

## 2.  Why we process your data — legal bases

- **Provide the service** (Art. 6 (1)(b) GDPR) – authenticate you, credit your account, deliver search results.
- **Prevent fraud & abuse** (Art. 6 (1)(f) GDPR) – keep a minimal record of e‑mail addresses that have already received free credits to stop repeated sign‑ups.
- **Compliance & accounting** (Art. 6 (1)(c)) – keep financial records required by tax law.

## 3.  Fraud‑prevention record

When you create an account, we add your Google‑login e‑mail address to the table **`free_credit_registry`**.
If you later delete your account, the address is _flagged as deleted_ but remains in the registry so the system recognises it and does **not** re‑issue free credits.
We never use this registry for marketing or profiling. You may object to this processing at any time (see §6).

## 4.  Retention & deletion

- **Active account** – e‑mail kept until you delete the account.
- **Fraud‑prevention registry** – e‑mail kept for up to **3 years** after deletion or until you object, whichever occurs first.
- **Support e‑mails** – kept for 12 months for reference, then erased.
- **LemonSqueezy records** – retained by LemonSqueezy per legal obligations (usually 10 years).

Account deletion is available in your profile settings or by e‑mail to **privacy@theboatscanner.com**. We respond within 72 hours.

## 5.  Analytics without cookies

We use self‑hosted **Umami** and **Cloudflare Web Analytics**. Both tools operate without client‑side cookies, localStorage or fingerprinting. They aggregate traffic statistics such as page views, referrer and device type. No personal identifiers are stored.

## 6.  Your rights

Under the GDPR you can:

- access the data we hold about you;
- request correction or deletion;
- object to processing based on legitimate interests (including the fraud‑prevention registry);
- request restriction or portability of your data;
- lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.

Contact us at **privacy@theboatscanner.com** to exercise these rights. We may need to verify your identity before acting on a request.
