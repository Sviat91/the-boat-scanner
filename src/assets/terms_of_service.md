_Last updated: 28 June 2025_

Welcome to **The Boat Scanner**. Please read these Terms of Service ("**Terms**", "**Agreement**") carefully before using the website and services located at **theboatscanner.com** (collectively, the “**Service**”). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.

## 1. Service description
The Boat Scanner provides an image‑based search tool that matches photographs of yachts and boats against public online listings (e.g. Facebook™ groups, broker sites) and returns links to matching ads together with basic meta‑information (title, price, location, thumbnail). We act **solely as an automated aggregator**; we do not create, host or moderate the third‑party listings surfaced by the Service.

## 2. Accounts & authentication
* You may sign in only via Google OAuth. You must provide a valid Google account and keep it secure.
* You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your account. Notify us immediately of any unauthorised use.
* You may delete your account at any time. Deletion triggers the data‑handling procedure described in our Privacy Policy.

## 3. Credits, pricing & refunds
* New accounts receive **3 free credits**. One credit is consumed for every image search you run, regardless of the number of matches returned.
* Additional credits or subscriptions are sold via **LemonSqueezy**. Prices are displayed before checkout and may change without notice for future purchases.
* Unless required by consumer law, **all sales are final**. In exceptional cases (e.g. double payment, technical failure) contact support@theboatscanner.com within 7 days and we will review the request.

## 4. Acceptable use
You agree **not** to:
1. Use automated scripts or bots to create accounts or scrape results.
2. Reverse‑engineer, decompile or attempt to extract the Service’s source code or models.
3. Upload images that are illegal, infringe copyright, or violate the privacy of others.
4. Misrepresent search results as your own data product without attribution.

Violation may result in immediate suspension and loss of unused credits.

## 5. Third‑party listings & disclaimer
* Listings are owned by third parties. We do **not** guarantee their accuracy, availability or authenticity.
* The Boat Scanner is **not** affiliated with Facebook, Meta or any listing platform referenced by the Service.
* You assume all risk when contacting sellers or acting on information returned by the Service.

## 6. Intellectual property & DMCA
* The Boat Scanner name, logo and proprietary code remain our property.
* If you are a rights holder and believe that a listing surfaced by the Service infringes your copyright, send a DMCA notice to **dmca@theboatscanner.com** with: (a) your contact details, (b) identification of the copyrighted work, (c) URL of the allegedly infringing listing, (d) a statement under penalty of perjury. We will promptly remove or block access to the content and notify the platform hosting it.

## 7. Termination
We may suspend or terminate your access at any time, with or without notice, if you breach these Terms, abuse the Service, or if required by law. Upon termination, unused credits are forfeited and the liability limits in §8 continue to apply.

## 8. Limitation of liability
The Service is provided **“as is” and “as available”** without warranties of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted by law, The Boat Scanner shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special or consequential damages, loss of profits, data or goodwill arising out of or in connection with your use of the Service.

## 9. Governing law & jurisdiction
These Terms are governed by the laws of Estonia. Any disputes shall be resolved exclusively in the courts of Tallinn, Estonia, unless applicable mandatory consumer‑protection laws provide otherwise.
